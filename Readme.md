1. Start by introducing myself.
2. Discuss in brief a couple of use cases that show how useful it can be to retrieve data from a WordPress instance from external applications.
3. Show them an example of any app that does stuff by logging-in with OAuth(Maybe Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter).
4. Briefly discuss how 2 and 3 could be achieved easily by using the upcoming REST API.
5. Demo time. Pull up a local install of WP and show the plugins screen with the REST API and associated plugins installed(Ask them to get the url from session notes.)
  - Show the result of an endpoint in a browser.
  - Show an html page with some javascript/jquery which does the same call but does something with the json.
6. Move on to audience for stuff/Q&A. Other stuff like concrete code examples, including write access to api via auth etc can move on to personal interactions/session overflow.
